    Batman is a superhero created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger for DC Comics, first appearing in Detective Comics #27 in May 1939.
 His alter ego is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist and philanthropist who resides in the fictional Gotham City.
 Batman's origin story centers on the traumatic murder of his parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, when he was a child after they were shot during a mugging outside a movie theater.
 This event led him to swear a lifelong oath to "war on all criminals" and dedicate his life to preventing similar tragedies.

Unlike many superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers; instead, he relies on his genius-level intellect, expert detective skills, masterful martial arts abilities, and extensive training in combat and strategy.
 He uses his vast wealth from Wayne Enterprises to fund his crime-fighting efforts, creating advanced technology and equipment such as the Batmobile, Batplane, Batcycle, and the Batcomputer housed in the Batcave beneath Wayne Manor.
 His iconic costume, featuring a bat symbol, cape, and cowl, is designed to instill fear in criminals, and his utility belt contains tools like batarangs, grapple guns, and night vision goggles.

Batman is a founding member of the Justice League and has led various teams, including the Bat-Family, Batman Incorporated, and the Outsiders.
 He is known by several aliases, including the Dark Knight, the Caped Crusader, and the World's Greatest Detective.
 His key allies include his butler and guardian Alfred Pennyworth, Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordon, and various sidekicks such as Robin (Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake, Damian Wayne) and Batgirl (Barbara Gordon, Cassandra Cain).
 He also has complex relationships with adversaries like the Joker, Catwoman, and Ra's al Ghul, often striving to uphold justice even for those who have committed crimes.

Batman has been adapted into numerous media forms, including live-action films, animated series, video games, and merchandise.
 He has been portrayed by actors such as Adam West, Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, Ben Affleck, and Robert Pattinson.
 In September 2024, he became the first superhero to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
 His character has evolved over decades, from a darker vigilante in the Golden Age to a campy figure in the 1960s, and back to a brooding, p
